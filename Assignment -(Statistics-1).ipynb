    "Interval Data:\n",
    "Interval data represents values with equal intervals between them. It does not have a true zero point but allows for meaningful calculations of differences between values. However,\n",

    "Ratio data has equal intervals between values and a true zero point. It allows for meaningful calculations of ratios, proportions, and differences between values. \n",

    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involves summarizing, organizing, and presenting data in a meaningful way.\n",
    "It focuses on describing the main characteristics and patterns within a dataset. Descriptive statistics provide a snapshot or summary of the data without making inferences beyond the observed sample. \n",

    "#Question 10--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, measures of central tendency and measures of variability are used to summarize and describe datasets. Here are some common measures of central tendency and variability and how they can be used to describe a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average value of a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of observations. The mean provides an estimate of the typical or average value in the dataset. It is sensitive to extreme values and can be influenced by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median represents the middle value in an ordered dataset. It is the value that separates the higher half from the lower half. The median is less sensitive to extreme values and is a robust measure of central tendency. It provides a measure of the central value that is not affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It represents the value or values that occur with the highest frequency. The mode is particularly useful for categorical or discrete data. It helps identify the most common category or value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance measures the spread or dispersion of values in a dataset. It quantifies how far each value in the dataset is from the mean. A higher variance indicates greater variability, while a lower variance suggests less variability. However, variance is influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average deviation of data points from the mean. The standard deviation is widely used due to its intuitive interpretation. A higher standard deviation indicates greater dispersion, while a lower standard deviation suggests less spread in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread or variability. However, the range is sensitive to outliers and may not capture the distribution of values in detail."
